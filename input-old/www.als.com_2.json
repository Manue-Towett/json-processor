SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.\n\nCombining the best Garmin fitness and outdoor watch features, the smaller-sized Fenix 7S multisport GPS watch blends cutting-edge design and performance with 7-day-a-week wearability.\n\nPERFORMANCE BY DESIGN\nUpdated, ultratough design features a bright 1.2\u201d display and 42 mm fiber-reinforced polymer case. The watch is tested to U.S. military standards for thermal, shock, and water resistance.\n\nTOUCHSCREEN AND BUTTONS\nTrusted button controls that work in any environment are matched with a new touchscreen interface for quick access to selections and functions.\n\nPREMIUM MATERIALS\nFit the watch\u2019s look to your lifestyle with a stylish stainless steel bezel.\n\nFEATURES\n\nBUILT-IN SPORTS APPS: Use preloaded activity profiles for trail running, swimming, running, biking, hiking, rowing, skiing, golfing, surfing, indoor climbing, and more.\nBACKCOUNTRY SKI: Stay informed when you\u2019re in the snow. This preloaded profile helps distinguish between skiing and climbing. It shows metrics specific to either ascent or descent.\nXC SKI DYNAMICS: When paired with the HRM-Pro\u2122 chest strap (sold separately), the ski power metric helps measure the actual exercise load of your cross-country workouts.\nSURF-READY FEATURES: Get ready to catch some waves. This fenix watch works with the Surfline Sessions\u2122 feature, which creates a video of every wave you ride in front of a Surfline\u00ae camera. So you can watch them later and see how you did with your Surfline Sessions subscription.\nMTB DYNAMICS: Track the details of every ride with mountain biking metrics plus specialized Grit\u2122 and Flow\u2122 measurements that rate trail difficulty and how smoothly you descend, giving you a score to beat next time.\nHIIT WORKOUTS: This activity profile tracks your high-intensity interval training workouts, including AMRAP, EMOM, Tabata, and custom. Set the number of rounds, work/rest intervals, and more.\nDAILY WORKOUT SUGGESTIONS: Get daily run and ride recommendations based on your current training load and training status for a training guide that takes you and your fitness level into account.\nVISUAL RACE PREDICTOR: Based on your running history and overall fitness level, this feature provides an estimate of what your pace could be for the distance you want to run.
